Changelog for @PACKAGE@
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-07-22 v1.0.5

    - Fixed a really edge-case MSIE8 CSS rendering issue with this module.
      The issue caused MSIE8 to ignore parts of the total CSS code,
      resulting in random page rendering issues.

    - Upgraded the included GeSHi package to version to 1.0.8.10.

    - Fixed PHP warning:
      Deprecated: Function split() is deprecated in ... bbcode_geshi.php

    - Fixed incorrect stripping of leading white space. Only leading white
      lines have to be stripped.

    - Improved rebuilding the CSS cache for this module, by also rebuilding
      it when the bbcode_geshi.php module file is updated. This improves
      rebuilding the cache during module development and after upgrades.

    - The CSS code now only contains the code for the activated languages
      in the module configuration.

2010-06-08 v1.0.4

    - Upgraded the included GeSHi package to version to 1.0.8.8.

    - Minor fix in the CSS to make line number appear correctly in MSIE.
