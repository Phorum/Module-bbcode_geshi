Module  : BBcode GeSHi (code syntax highlighting)
Version : 1.0.4
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module implements syntax highlighting by extending the BBcode
[code] tag. It can be used for adding syntax highlighted program code to
messages. For highlighting, the excellent GeSHi (Generic Syntax Highlighter)
package is used.

1. Installation
2. Examples
3. Editor Tools support
4. Upgrading the GeSHi package


1. Installation:
----------------

  - Unpack the archive;

  - Move the directory "bbcode_geshi" to the directory "mods"
    within your Phorum installation;

  - Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
    go to the "Modules" section;

  - Enable the module "BBcode GeSHi (code syntax highlighting)";

  - After this, go to the module's settings screen to configure
    the settings for this module.


2. Examples:
------------

  For doing syntax highlighting, the code tag has to be told what kind of
  coding language is contained in it. The general basic syntax is:

    [code="language"]
    block of;
    programming code;
    that has to be {
      syntax;
      highlighted;
    }
    [/code]

  All available languages can be found in the mods/bbcode_geshi/geshi/geshi/
  directory. The basename of the file (filename without ".php" at the end)
  can be used as a language. For example, PHP code can be added using:

    [code="php"]
    function say_hello($who) {
        print "Hello, $who!\n";
    }
    say_hello("World");
    [/code]

  For adding line numbering to the highlighted code, use one of the
  following syntaxes:

    [code="language" number] ... [/code]         to start numbering at 1
    [code="language" number="1234"] ... [/code]  to start numbering at 1234

  For those who are accustomed to the original phpBB tags that are used for
  GeSHi, it is also possible to use [syntax="language"]:

    [syntax="language" number="1234"] ... [/syntax]


3. Editor Tools support:
------------------------

  If you have installed and enabled the Editor Tools module and if you have
  enabled the [code] tool button in the BBcode configuration, then you can
  also make use of Editor Tools support by this module.

  In the module settings, you can enable the tool button support. If enabled,
  the original tool button behavior (adding [code]..[/code] to the message)
  will be overridden. Instead it will show a drop down list of languages and
  some options for line numbering, which can be used to add the correct [code]
  tag to the message in a very easy way.

  What languages are shown in the drop down list is determined by the
  settings that you do in the admin module settings for this module.
  There you can select exactly what languages will be available in the
  menu and whether line numbering support is enabled.


4. Upgrading the GeSHi package:
-------------------------------

  Upgrading the GeSHi package is quite easy. Here are the neccessary steps:

    - Download GeSHi from the web site http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

    - Unpack the downloaded zip file.

    - Copy "geshi.php" and the "geshi" directory to the "geshi" directory
      that can be found below this module's directory. The other files and
      directories are not needed for GeSHi to function.

    - Since we provide a plain text syntax ourselves (resulting in the
      standard [code] tag), we do not need the "text" syntax provided by
      GeSHi. Delete "geshi/geshi/text.php".
